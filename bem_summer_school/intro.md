# BEM Summer School Lecture Notes

These lecture notes collect the training material for the lectures by
Timo Betcke at the 2022 GCCE Summer School on Boundary Element Methods.

For practical examples we will use the Boundary Element Software [Bempp](https://bempp.com).

For the use of Bempp we recommend the [installation as Docker image](https://bempp.com/installation.html).
