    "We assume that we have $N$ particles $x_i$, $i=1, \\dots, N$ in $[0, 1]^d$ for $d=2,3$. Let $G$ be the matrix of Green's function interactions defined by $G[i, j] = g(x_i, x_j)$. Hence, we assume that we have the same set of source and target particles. This is no restriction.\n",

    "As a first step we setup a quadtree/octree over $[0, 1]^d$. As opposed to the earlier descriptions, where we used an adaptive tree for simplicity we will setup a regular tree of depth $L$. The root is level zero. The set of leaf boxes is denoted by $\\mathcal{L}$. Each box in the tree gets a unique integer identifier $m$ that is identified with an associated box $B_m$ in the octree/quadtree. By $\\text{level}(m)$ we denote the level of the box with identifier $m$. The set of children of this box are denoted by $\\mathcal{C}(m)$, and the parent is denoted by $\\mathcal{P}(m)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote by $x_{i_{\\ell}^{m}}$, $\\ell=1, \\dots, N_m$ the particles contained in the box $m\\in\\mathcal{L}$. Hence, $N = \\sum_{m\\in\\mathcal{L}}N_{m}$. For simplicity we assume that all leaf boxes contain particles. In practical implementations, if a leaf box has no particles it is just omitted.\n",

    "![interaction_list](interaction_list.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote all boxes directly adjacent to our target box as nearfield and call it $\\mathcal{N}(m)$. These boxes do not satisfy an admissibility condition. Hence, we cannot use efficient low-rank evaluations with them. However, for all other boxes we could use a low-rank evaluation as those boxes satisfy an admissibility condition. This would give us some improvement as we increase $N$. But, we are then also getting more and more direct evaluations in the nearfield and the method is not efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of the FMM is to deal with the nearfield by recursing down the tree. Assume that we have already computed on the parent level all admissible interactions, that is everything but the nearfield neighbours on the parent level.\n",

    "We now move down again to the level of our target box and split the children of the neighbours of the parent into nearfield boxes (those adjacent to our target) and boxes\n",
