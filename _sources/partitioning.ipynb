    "# Tree partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    " In this section we discuss partitioning strategies for our computational domain that let us sort our sources and targets into admissible and non-admissible pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, Hierarchical Matrix methods use binary cluster trees to partition the computational domain, and Fast Multipole Methods use partitioning based on Octrees. In the following we will discuss both types of trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we talk about these two types of trees let us remind of the mathematical definition of a tree. We denote a graph as a tuple $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is a set of vertices, and $E$ is a set of edges, connecting two vertices. We call a graph undirected if the edges have no orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we deal with a special type of undirected graph, namely a tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition** A tree is an undirected graph $(G, E)$ in which any two vertices are connected by a unique simple path (in a simple path all vertices are distinct).\n",
    "\n",
    "We designate one vertex in the tree as root. The parent of a vertex $v$ is the vertex directly connected to the root on the unique path to the root. The children of a verte $v$ are those vertices for which $v$ is a parent. We denote the set of children of $v$ by $\\mathcal{C}(v)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that a vertex is a leaf if it has no children. We denote the set of leafs as $\\mathcal{L}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The level $\\ell(v)$ of a vertex $v$ is the number of edges on the direct path from $v$ to the root $r$. The root itself has level $0$, its children have level $1$. The depth of a tree is the maximum over all levels in the tree, that is $\\text{depth} := \\max_{v\\in V}\\ell(v)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity in this section we assume that we have $N$ points $x_i\\in [0, 1]^d$, $i=1,\\dots, N$, $d=2, 3$. By $J:=\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ we denote the corresponding index set.\n",

    "A cluster tree is a tree over the index set $J$ in which each vertex $v$ is associated with an index set $J_v\\subset $J$ satisfying the following conditions.\n",

    "- The index set of the root $r$ of the tree is $J$.\n",
    "- For each vertex $v$ that is not a leaf the following two conditions hold\n",
    "    - The index sets of the children of $v$ are disjoint, that is for $c, c'\\in \\mathcal{C}(v)$ and $c\\neq c'$ we have that $J_c\\cap J_{c'} = \\emptyset$.\n",
    "    - The union of the index sets of the children are identical to the index set of the parent, that is $J_v = \\bigcup_{c\\in\\mathcal{C}(v)} J_c$.\n",
    "- For each vertex $v$ that is not a leaf the number of children is larger than one, that is $|\\mathcal{C}(v)| > 1$.\n",

    "In the following we implement simple data structures to construct a cluster tree. We have two classes, a bounding box class that stores geometric bounding boxes, and a Node class that stores an index set, allows subdivision and returns depth and leaf information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important part is the subdivision. For subdivision we choose the dimension along which the bounding box is longest. We then compute the mean of the points in the index set along this dimension and separate the points by those who are smaller than the mean and those which are larger. From these we construct two new nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There can be the pathological case that all points are aligned along aline. Then this strategy would leave one of the two new index sets empty. In that case we try to subdivide across the other dimension. If that fails as well we raise an exception since in that case all points in the index set are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursive partitioning proceeds until the children have fewer than a given parameter ``nmin`` indices. This is chosen by the user and determines the depth of the tree."
